This is a project a made my first rest api app, with back-end using spring.

You can combine this project with the "Angular-Project-Stock-Frond-End" to check the full edition of my app.

My project has some issues and bugs but i did for a better and deeper understanding of the rest api,crud operations and etc.

Final total time this project was around 1 week :).
