My first project rest-end API application using a spring.

You can combine this project with "Angular-Project-Stock-Frond-End" to check the full version of my application.

My project has some issues and bugs, but I did it for a better and deeper understanding of the other API, crud functions, etc.

The final total time for this project was about 1-week :).
